- All games that contain a certain champion: 
db.games.find( { comp_key : { $mod : [<champion_prime_key>, 0 ] } }).toArray()

- All games that contain a certain composition (of any amount of champions)
db.games.find( { comp_key : { $mod : [<prime1 * prime2 * ... * prime5>, 0 ] } }).toArray()

- Win percentage of a certain composition
-- Find the composition
-- Loop through the games, and add 1 to win and 1 to losses
-- Divide wins/losses

- Highest win percentage champion
-- Loop through all games
--- If win, add +1 to some dictionary that contains dict_name['champion_id']['wins']
--- If loss, add +1 to the same dictionary, dict_name['champion_id']['losses']
-- Loop through your dictionary, finding a max value of ['wins'] / ['losses'] and saving the ID
